Conference Central
==================

## Summary

Conference Central registration web app allows users to create new conferences, sessions, speakers and provides functionality for users to add a session to their wishlist or to attend.

All the functionality is implemented in a web service architecture so that it is independent for a particular platform (e.g web) and can be easily extended to different platforms (e.g Android, iOS). The app's full functinoality can be tested through APIs explorer.

This project is done as a part of Udacity Full Stack Web Development Nanodegree program.
